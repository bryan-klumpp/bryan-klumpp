Hi, I’m @bryan-klumpp.  I’m interested in:
  - finding the best balance among simplicity, resilience, and maintainability in my code
  - teaching others to do the same
  - creating tools to enable teams to develop software at a higher level
  - trying to keep up with AI, which has a chance of making all of the skills above obsolete
